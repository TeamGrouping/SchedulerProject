# SchedulerProject

Purpose:
As every student have their own schedule, grouping students according to their availability
and teammate requests manually can be very difficult. This project will make grouping easy,with no manual labor required.

Scope:
When students give their schedules as input, the system returns it as a file. Those files can be uploaded and the program will group the students according to their available timings and groups them into teams.

Objective:
Final outcome of the application is a file that can be exported with all the students grouped
into teams (TSP-SPM teams).

Admin.html and calendar.html are the primary files, index.php is used to interface with the webhosted files, and it will not be useable by end users.
