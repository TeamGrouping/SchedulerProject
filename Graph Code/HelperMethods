HELPER METHODS

//1.)Method to check to see if teammate requests are mutual. INPUTS VERTEX RETURNS BOOLEAN

//2.) Getter methof to check how many edges a vertex has INPUT VERTEX RETURNS INT.

3.) Getter method for vertices RETURNS VERTEX

4.) Method to check if sections are compatible. RETURNS 0 	(if different TSP Sections)
							1	(if same TSP section)
							2	(if TSP-SPM)

//5.) Organize vertices from same sections together in structure so 5 may not be necessary.

6.) Method to delete all edges from a vertex except those in their group (returns nothing)
   -- can call removeEdge for all edges necessary.

7.) Method to compile hours from students into shared hours. Likely setup will be array of group,
	even of size one, to allow for existing groups to be used here as well, and then another 	sole vertex to be added to the hours. So (array[vertices], vertex). These shared hours on
	which the group is joined should be the only way that students are added to the group
	thereafter.

8.)Method for flagging students (vertex, flag). This will not decide if they are eligible, but
	rather apply the flag when told to and checked elsewhere. The purpose of flags is to output
	to Walker any issues that go down. Returns nothing?

9.) Method to list students in an array according to number of connections. (that method should
	already exist). This should also be continuously run each time a distribution iteration
	occurs. The purpose is to always have people with least connections towards the front.
