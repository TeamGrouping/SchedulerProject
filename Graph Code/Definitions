CONNECTION: A connection is defined as at least one shared hour between two relevant students. Connections for each student should be stored in a way so that there is an element for
		each shared hour. Perhaps a graph where all shared hours between students are edges, and whenever a group is made, delete all edges to those students that weren't
		used to create the group, as they are no longer eligible for team placement.

SHARED CONNECTION: A shared connection is defined as when a group of students have not only connections with each other, but also a connection that aligns them upon at least one hour.
		This is used to simply say that x students have at least one shared connection, meaning they have at least one hour a week they can meet together.


GROUPING: To create a group, a TSP student must have shared hours (CONNECTION) with at least two more TSP students, and those at least two more TSP students must have connections with
		eachother. This indicates that they have at least one hour where every group member has indicated that they can be together. The TSP students must have at least one
		shared connection with at least one SPM student as well.

ISOLATED: Isolated means they have potential connections, but they are all destroyed through the use of the algorithm. This is the case when creating a group is done tactially 
		so that less students are isolated than must be.

CONTINUOUS: Continuous means that it does not have a predetermined point in the code, but rather should be exectuted whenever an event happens that is relevant to its condition,
		specified in the algorithm.

DISCARDED: Discarded means permanently remove so that the algorithm no longer takes it into consideration.
